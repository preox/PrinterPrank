# PrinterPrank
Small Perl-script. 
Too Feed silly messages and daily weather to the LCD-display of 
certain HP Laser Jet printers. 

Exakt location will need to be hardcoded (sorry), as well as IP-adresses of printer(s).

This script was used on a linux-based server and called once every 10 minutes by a cron-job.
